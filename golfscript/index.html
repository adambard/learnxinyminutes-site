<p>GolfScript is an esoteric language that was developed in 2007 by Darren
Smith. It is a scripting language with an interpreter written in Ruby. It lets
you write very dense code in very few characters. The main goal of the language
is, as the name suggests, to solve problems in as few keystrokes as possible.
The examples page on the GolfScript website even has an entire Sudoku solver
written in just 77 characters.</p>
<p>If you get really good at GolfScript you can easily find yourself using it as a
go-to language for solving some (even somewhat hard) coding problems. It's never
going to be faster than Ruby, but it can be very fast to write, since a single
character of GolfScript can replace an entire line of code in some other languages.</p>
<p>GolfScript is based on the use of the stack. This tutorial therefore will
read as a sequence of stack operations on an actual stack, as opposed to some
standalone code and individual results. The stack starts as an empty list, and
everything either adds to the stack, or it pops some items off, transforms them,
and puts them back onto the stack.</p>
<p>To get started running GolfScript, you can get the golfscript.rb file from the
<a href="https://github.com/darrenks/golfscript">GitHub repo</a>.  Copy it into your <code>$PATH</code>,
(dropping the .rb and chmodding as necessary). You can run GolfScript from either
the interactive interpreter (which mirrors the tutorial below). Once you get the hang
of GolfScript, you can start running from &quot;stdin&quot;. If you see a script starting with <code>~</code>,
it was probably designed to be dropped in a file and run with <code>golfscript file.gs</code>.  You
can pipe in or enter in your input at runtime.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>&gt; anything undefined technically evaluates to nothing and so is also a comment
# but commenting it out explicitly anyway is probably a good idea because if
# you use a reserved keyword or any punctuation you&#39;ll run into trouble.

# to the stack.  This is typically referred to as postfix notation.  It can be

########################################################################
# Let&#39;s go through the process for writing a script. There are some tricks and
# ways to think about things. Let&#39;s take a simple example: a prime sieve.
# There are a few strategies for sieving. First, there&#39;s a strategy that
# uses two lists, candidates and primes. We pop a value from candidates,
# remove all the candidates divisible by it, and then add it to the primes.
# Second, there&#39;s just a filtering operation on numbers. I think it&#39;s
# probably shorter to write a program that just checks if a number has no
# numbers mod zero besides 0, 1, and itself. Slower, but shorter is king.

# Closing Tips for getting to the next level:
# 0. using lookback might be more effective than swapping around the values.
#    for instance, 1$1$ and \.@.@.\ do the same thing: duplicate last two items
#    but the former is more obvious and shorter.
# 1. golfscript can be fun to use for messing around with integer sequences or
#    do other cool math. So, don&#39;t be afraid to define your own functions to
#    make your life easier, like
&gt; {$0=}:min; {$-1=}:max; {.,(;{*}*.*\%}:isprime; {.|}:set; # etc.
# 2. write pseudocode in another language or port a script over to figure out
#    what&#39;s going on. Especially useful when you combine this strategy with
#    algebra engines. For instance, you can port the examples-page 1000 digits
#    of pi to python and get:
#        import sympy as sp
#        a, k = sp.var(&#39;a&#39;), list(range(20))[1::2]
#        for _ in range(len(k)-1):
#            m = k.pop()
#            l = k.pop()
#            k.append(((l+1)//2*m)//(l+2)+2*a)
#        print(str(k[0]))
#    which gives &quot;2*a + floor(2*a/3 + floor(4*a/5 + 2*floor(6*a/7 + 3*floor(
#    8*a/9 + 4*floor(10*a/11 + 5*floor(12*a/13 + 6*floor(14*a/15 + 7*floor(16*
#    a/17 + 72/17)/15)/13)/11)/9)/7)/5)/3)&quot;... which makes it much more obvious
#    what&#39;s going on than 10.3??:a;20,-2%{2+.2/@*\/a 2*+}* especially when
#    you&#39;re new to the language
# 3. a little math goes a long way. The above prime test uses Wilson&#39;s theorem
#    a comparable program testing for factors {:i,(;{i\%!},(;!}:isprime is
#    longer and slower. Also, as discussed above, Collatz is much shorter if
#    you recognize that you can do (3x+1) and then divide by 6 to the power
#    ((3x+1) mod 2).  (If x was even, (3x+1) is now odd, so 3x+1 div 6 is x/2.)
#    avoiding conditionals and redundancy can sometimes require such insight.
#    And of course, unless you know this continued fraction of pi it&#39;s hard to
#    calculate it in a terse block of code.
# 4. don&#39;t be afraid to define variables and use arrays! particularly if you
#    have 4 or more items to shuffle.
# 5. don&#39;t be afraid to use [some_long_script] to pack a bunch of items in an
#    array after the fact, rather than gathering or adding them later or
#    forcing yourself to use a datastructure that keeps the items in an array
# 6. sometimes you might get in a jam with - followed by an int that can be
#    solved with ^ to do a symmetric set difference without adding a space
# 7. &quot;#{require &#39;net/http&#39;;Net::HTTP.get_response(URI.parse(address)).body}&quot;
#    can get any page source from the internet, substituting &#39;address&#39; for your
#    URL. Try it with an OEIS b-file or wordlists, etc. You can also use the
#    shorter &quot;#{File.open(&#39;filename.txt&#39;).read}&quot; to read in a file. GolfScript
#    can run &quot;#{any_ruby_code_here}&quot; and add the results to the stack.
# 8. you can set anything to mean anything, which can be useful for golf:
#       3:^;^2?  =&gt; 9 because this set ^ to 3, and 3 2 ? =&gt; 9
#       3:a;a2?  =&gt; Warning: pop on empty stack - because a2 doesn&#39;t exist
#       3:a;a 2? =&gt; 9 - it works again, but takes an extra character over ^2
#    usually you will only want to do this once you&#39;re trying to squeeze the
#    last few chars out of your code because it ruins your environment.
