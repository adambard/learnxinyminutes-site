    <p><strong>Sed</strong> is a standard tool on every POSIX-compliant UNIX system.
It&rsquo;s like an editor, such as Vim, Visual Studio Code, Atom, or Sublime.
However, rather than typing the commands interactively, you
provide them on the command line or in a file.</p>

<p><em>Sed</em>&lsquo;s advantages over an interactive editor is that it can be easily
used to automate text processing tasks, and that it can process
efficiently huge (terabyte-sized) files.
It can perform more complex tasks than <em>grep</em> and for many text
processing tasks its commands are much shorter than what you would
write in <em>awk</em>, <em>Perl</em>, or <em>Python</em>.</p>

<p><em>Sed</em> works by reading a line of text (by default from its standard
input, unless some files are specified as arguments), processing
it with the specified commands, and then outputting the result
on its standard output.
You can suppress the default output by specifying the <code>-n</code> command-line
argument.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight perl"><code><span class="c1">#!/usr/bin/sed -f</span>
<span class="c1"># Files that begin with the above line and are given execute permission</span>
<span class="c1"># can be run as regular scripts.</span>

<span class="c1"># Comments are like this.</span>

<span class="c1"># Commands consist of a single letter and many can be preceded</span>
<span class="c1"># by a specification of the lines to which they apply.</span>

<span class="c1"># Delete the input's third line.</span>
<span class="mi">3</span><span class="nv">d</span>

<span class="c1"># The same command specified the command line as an argument to sed:</span>
<span class="c1"># sed 3d</span>

<span class="c1"># For many commands the specification can consist of two addresses,</span>
<span class="c1"># which select an inclusive range.</span>
<span class="c1"># Addresses can be specified numerically ($ is the last line) or through</span>
<span class="c1"># regular expressions delimited by /.</span>

<span class="c1"># Delete lines 1-10</span>
<span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="nv">d</span>

<span class="c1"># Lines can also be specified as regular expressions, delimited by /.</span>

<span class="c1"># Delete empty lines.</span>
<span class="sr">/^$/d</span>

<span class="c1"># Delete blocks starting with SPOILER-BEGIN and ending with SPOILER-END.</span>
<span class="sr">/SPOILER-BEGIN/</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="sr">/SPOILER-END/d</span>

<span class="c1"># A command without an address is applied to all lines.</span>

<span class="c1"># List lines in in a visually unambiguous form (e.g. tab appears as \t).</span>
<span class="nv">l</span>

<span class="c1"># A command prefixed by ! will apply to non-matching lines.</span>
<span class="c1"># Keep only lines starting with a #.</span>
<span class="sr">/^#/</span><span class="o">!</span><span class="nv">d</span>

<span class="c1"># Below are examples of the most often-used commands.</span>

<span class="c1"># Substitute the first occurence in a line of John with Mary.</span>
<span class="sr">s/John/Mary/</span>

<span class="c1"># Remove all underscore characters (global substitution).</span>
<span class="sr">s/_//g</span>

<span class="c1"># Remove all HTML tags.</span>
<span class="sr">s/&lt;[^&gt;]*&gt;//g</span>

<span class="c1"># In the replacement string &amp; is the regular expression matched.</span>

<span class="c1"># Put each line inside double quotes.</span>
<span class="sr">s/.*/"&amp;"/</span>

<span class="c1"># In the matched regular expression \(pattern\) is used to store</span>
<span class="c1"># a pattern into a buffer.</span>
<span class="c1"># In the replacement string \1 refers to the first pattern, \2 to the second</span>
<span class="c1"># and so on. \u converts the following character to uppercase \l to lowercase.</span>

<span class="c1"># Convert snake_case_identifiers into camelCaseIdentifiers.</span>
<span class="sr">s/_\(.\)/\u\1/g</span>


<span class="c1"># The p (print) command is typically used together with the -n</span>
<span class="c1"># command-line option, which disables the print by default functionality.</span>
<span class="c1"># Output all lines between ``` and ```.</span>
<span class="sr">/```/</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="sr">/```/p</span>


<span class="c1"># The y command maps characters from one set to another.</span>
<span class="c1"># Swap decimal and thousand separators (1,234,343.55 becomes 1.234.343,55).</span>
<span class="sr">y/.,/,./</span>

<span class="c1"># Quit after printing the line starting with END.</span>
<span class="sr">/^END/</span><span class="sx">q

</span><span class="c1"># You can stop reading here, and still get 80% of sed's benefits.</span>
<span class="c1"># Below are examples of how you can specify multiple sed commands.</span>

<span class="c1"># You can apply multiple commands by separating them with a newline or</span>
<span class="c1"># a semicolon.</span>

<span class="c1"># Delete the first and the last line.</span>
<span class="mi">1</span><span class="nv">d</span>
<span class="nv">$d</span>

<span class="c1"># Delete the first and the last line.</span>
<span class="mi">1</span><span class="nv">d</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="nv">$d</span>


<span class="c1"># You can group commands in { } blocks.</span>

<span class="c1"># Convert first line to uppercase and print it.</span>
<span class="mi">1</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="sr">s/./\u&amp;/g</span>
  <span class="nv">p</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="c1"># Convert first line to uppercase and print it (less readable one-liner).</span>
<span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="sr">s/./\u&amp;/g</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="nv">p</span><span class="p">;}</span>


<span class="c1"># You can also stop reading here, if you're not interested in creating</span>
<span class="c1"># sed script files.</span>

<span class="c1"># Below are more advanced commands.  You typically put these in a file</span>
<span class="c1"># rather than specify them on a command line.  If you have to use</span>
<span class="c1"># many of these commands in a script, consider using a general purpose</span>
<span class="c1"># scripting language, such as Python or Perl.</span>

<span class="c1"># Append a line containing "profile();" after each line ending with ";".</span>
<span class="sr">/;$/a</span><span class="o">\</span>
<span class="nv">profile</span><span class="p">();</span>

<span class="c1"># Insert a line containing "profile();" before each line ending with ";".</span>
<span class="sr">/;$/i</span><span class="o">\</span>
<span class="nv">profile</span><span class="p">();</span>

<span class="c1"># Change each line text inside REDACTED blocks into [REDACTED].</span>
<span class="sr">/REDACTED-BEGIN/</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="sr">/REDACTED-END/c</span><span class="o">\</span>
<span class="p">[</span><span class="nv">REDACTED</span><span class="p">]</span>

<span class="c1"># Replace the tag "&lt;ourstyle&gt;" by reading and outputting the file style.css.</span>
<span class="sr">/&lt;ourstyle&gt;/</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nv">r</span> <span class="nv">style</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="nv">css</span>
  <span class="nv">d</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="c1"># Change each line inside REDACTED blocks into [REDACTED].</span>
<span class="c1"># Also write (append) a copy of the redacted text in the file redacted.txt.</span>
<span class="sr">/REDACTED-BEGIN/</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="sr">/REDACTED-END/</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nv">w</span> <span class="nv">redacted</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="nv">txt</span>
  <span class="nv">c</span><span class="o">\</span>
  <span class="p">[</span><span class="nv">REDACTED</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="c1"># All operations described so far operate on a buffer called "pattern space".</span>
<span class="c1"># In addition, sed offers another buffer called "hold space".</span>
<span class="c1"># The following commands operate on the two, and can be used to keep</span>
<span class="c1"># state or combine multiple lines.</span>

<span class="c1"># Replace the contents of the pattern space with the contents of</span>
<span class="c1"># the hold space.</span>
<span class="nv">g</span>

<span class="c1"># Append a newline character followed by the contents of the hold</span>
<span class="c1"># space to the pattern space.</span>
<span class="nv">G</span>

<span class="c1"># Replace the contents of the hold space with the contents of the</span>
<span class="c1"># pattern space.</span>
<span class="nv">h</span>

<span class="c1"># Append a newline character followed by the contents of the</span>
<span class="c1"># pattern space to the hold space.</span>
<span class="nv">H</span>

<span class="c1"># Delete the initial segment of the pattern space through the first</span>
<span class="c1"># newline character and start the next cycle.</span>
<span class="nv">D</span>

<span class="c1"># Replace the contents of the pattern space with the contents of</span>
<span class="c1"># the hold space.</span>
<span class="nv">g</span>

<span class="c1"># Append a newline character followed by the contents of the hold</span>
<span class="c1"># space to the pattern space.</span>
<span class="nv">G</span>

<span class="c1"># Replace the contents of the hold space with the contents of the</span>
<span class="c1"># pattern space.</span>
<span class="nv">h</span>

<span class="c1"># Append a newline character followed by the contents of the</span>
<span class="c1"># pattern space to the hold space.</span>
<span class="nv">H</span>

<span class="c1"># Write the pattern space to the standard output if the default</span>
<span class="c1"># output has not been suppressed, and replace the pattern space</span>
<span class="c1"># with the next line of input.</span>
<span class="nv">n</span>

<span class="c1"># Append the next line of input to the pattern space, using an</span>
<span class="c1"># embedded newline character to separate the appended material from</span>
<span class="c1"># the original contents.  Note that the current line number</span>
<span class="c1"># changes.</span>
<span class="nv">N</span>

<span class="c1"># Write the pattern space, up to the first newline character to the</span>
<span class="c1"># standard output.</span>
<span class="nv">P</span>

<span class="c1"># Swap the contents of the pattern and hold spaces.</span>
<span class="nv">x</span>

<span class="c1"># Here is a complete example of some of the buffer commands.</span>
<span class="c1"># Move the file's first line to its end.</span>
<span class="mi">1</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nv">h</span>
  <span class="nv">d</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="err">$</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nv">p</span>
  <span class="nv">x</span>
<span class="p">}</span>


<span class="c1"># Three sed commands influence a script's control flow</span>

<span class="c1"># Name this script position "my_label", to which the "b" and</span>
<span class="c1"># "t" commands may branch.</span>
<span class="p">:</span><span class="nv">my_label</span>

<span class="c1"># Continue executing commands from the position of my_label.</span>
<span class="nv">b</span> <span class="nv">my_label</span>

<span class="c1"># Branch to the end of the script.</span>
<span class="nv">b</span>

<span class="c1"># Branch to my_label if any substitutions have been made since the most</span>
<span class="c1"># recent reading of an input line or execution of a "t" (test) function.</span>
<span class="nv">t</span> <span class="nv">my_label</span>

<span class="c1"># Here is a complete example of branching</span>
<span class="c1"># Join lines that end with a backspace into a single space-separated one</span>

<span class="c1"># Name this position "loop"</span>
<span class="p">:</span> <span class="nv">loop</span>
<span class="c1"># On lines ending with a backslash</span>
<span class="sr">/\\$/</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="c1"># Read the next line and append it to the pattern space</span>
  <span class="nv">N</span>
  <span class="c1"># Substitute backslash newline with a space</span>
  <span class="sr">s/\\\n/ /</span>
  <span class="c1"># Branch to the top for testing this line's ending</span>
