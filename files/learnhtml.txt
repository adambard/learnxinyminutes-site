<!-- Here is an example HTML file that we are going to analyse. -->


<!doctype html>
	<html>
		<head>
			<title>My Site</title>
		</head>
		<body>
			<h1>Hello, world!</h1>
			<a href="http://codepen.io/anon/pen/xwjLbZ">
				Come look at what this shows
			</a>
			<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
			<p>This is another paragraph.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>This is an item in a non-enumerated list (bullet list)</li>
				<li>This is another item</li>
				<li>And this is the last item on the list</li>
			</ul>

<!--
	An HTML file always starts by indicating to the browser that the page is HTML.
-->
<!doctype html>

<!-- After this, it starts by opening an <html> tag. -->
<html>

<!-- that will be closed at the end of the file with </html>. -->
</html>

<!-- Nothing should appear after this final tag. -->

<!-- Inside (between the opening and closing tags <html></html>), we find: -->

<!-- A header defined by <head> (it must be closed with </head>). -->
<!--
	The header contains some description and additional information which are not
	displayed; this is metadata.
-->

<head>
	<!--
		The tag <title> indicates to the browser the title to show in browser
		window's title bar and tab name.
	-->
	<title>My Site</title>
</head>

<!-- After the <head> section, we find the tag - <body> -->
<!-- Until this point, nothing described will show up in the browser window. -->
<!-- We must fill the body with the content to be displayed. -->

<body>
	<!-- The h1 tag creates a title. -->
	<h1>Hello, world!</h1>
	<!--
		There are also subtitles to <h1> from the most important (h2) to the most
		precise (h6).
	-->

	<!-- a hyperlink to the url given by the attribute href="" -->
	<a href="http://codepen.io/anon/pen/xwjLbZ">
		Come look at what this shows
	</a>

	<!-- The tag <p> lets us include text in the html page. -->
	<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
	<p>This is another paragraph.</p>

	<!-- The tag <ul> creates a bullet list. -->
	<!--
		To have a numbered list instead we would use <ol> giving 1. for the first
		element, 2. for the second, etc.
	-->
	<ul>
		<li>This is an item in a non-enumerated list (bullet list)</li>
		<li>This is another item</li>
		<li>And this is the last item on the list</li>
	</ul>
</body>

<!-- And that's it, creating an HTML file can be simple. -->

<!-- But it is possible to add many additional types of HTML tags. -->

<!-- The <img /> tag is used to insert an image. -->
<!--
	The source of the image is indicated using the attribute src=""
	The source can be an URL or even path to a file on your computer.
-->
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/XWG0O.gif"/>

<!-- It is also possible to create a table. -->

<!-- We open a <table> element. -->
<table>

	<!-- <tr> allows us to create a row. -->
	<tr>

		<!-- <th> allows us to give a title to a table column. -->
		<th>First Header</th>
		<th>Second Header</th>
	</tr>

	<tr>

		<!-- <td> allows us to create a table cell. -->
		<td>first row, first column</td>
		<td>first row, second column</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
		<td>second row, first column</td>
		<td>second row, second column</td>
	</tr>
</table>
